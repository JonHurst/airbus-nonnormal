      <title>Rejected Takeoff</title>
      <para>[EOM B.3.2.10, FCOM 3.2.10.1000]</para>

      <para>The decision to reject rests solely with CM1. This decision is communicated with the words "Stop" or
      "Continue". "Stop" implies that CM1 is taking control of the aircraft. Below 100kt the RTO is relatively risk free
      and a decision to stop should be made for any ECAM and most other problems. Above 100kt the RTO may be hazardous
      and stopping should only be considered for loss of engine thrust, any fire warning, any uninhibited ECAM or
      anything which indicates the aircraft will be unsafe or unable to fly.</para>
      
      <para>If a stop is required, CM1 calls "Stop" while simultaneously bringing the thrust levers to idle, then to max
      reverse. If the stop was commenced below 72kt the ground spoilers will not automatically deploy and the autobrake
      will therefore not engage. Monitor automatic braking, and if there is any doubt, apply manual braking as
      required. If normal braking fails, announce "Loss of braking" and proceed with the loss of braking memory items
      (see <xref linkend="loss-of-braking"/>). If the reason for the stop was an engine fire on the upwind side,
      consider turning the aircraft to keep the fire away from the fuselage. If there is any chance of requiring
      evacuation, bring the aircraft to a complete halt, stow the reversers, apply the parking brake, and order
      "Attention, crew at stations" on the PA. If evacuation will definitely not be required, once the aircraft's safety
      is assured, the RTO can be discontinued and the runway cleared. In this case make a PA of "Cabin crew, normal
      operations".</para>

      <para>During this initial phase, CM2 confirms reverse ("Reverse green"), confirms deceleration ("Decel"), cancels
      any audio warnings, informs ATC and announces "70 knots" when appropriate. CM2 then locates the emergency
      evacuation checklist.</para>

      <para>Once the aircraft has stopped, CM1 takes the radios and asks CM2 to carry out any required ECAM
      actions. Whilst the ECAM actions are being completed, CM1 will build up a decision as to whether to evacuate. If
      an evacuation is required see <xref linkend="evacuation"/>. Otherwise order "Cabin crew, normal
      operations".</para>

      <para>If the aircraft has come to a complete halt using autobrake MAX, the brakes can be released by disarming the
      spoilers.</para>

        <title>Failures during takeoff when above V1</title>
        <para>[FCOM 3.2.10.2000]</para>

        <para>If an engine has lost thrust, apply rudder conventionally on the runway. At V<subscript>r</subscript>
        rotate to 12½° at a slightly reduced rate. When airborne, adjust rudder to maintain &beta; target. Bank angle
        should be limited to 15° when more than 3kt below maneuvering speed for the current configuration. Engage the
        autopilot once gear is up and rudder is trimmed. Consider the use of TOGA if a FLX takeoff was carried
        out.</para>

        <para>Whilst below 400ft, the only failure related actions should be:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>If applicable, PNF should announcement "Engine failure" or "Engine fire" without specifying an
          engine.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>Cancellation of master warning or master caution when both pilots confirm they are aware of
          it.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>Heightened awareness of the possibility of missing essential normal actions, such as calling
          rotate or raising the gear due to the distraction of the failure.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>Once above 400ft with safe flight path assured, decide on an initial strategy. In general, where
        a loss of thrust has occured or will occur, the strategy will be to fly the EOSID with a three segment
        climb profile (see <xref linkend="eosid"/>). Otherwise, it will be to remain on the normal SID and fly
        a normal climb profile. Any deviation from the cleared SID will require ATC to be informed as a
        priority, usually as part of a PAN or MAYDAY message. In rare cases where the cleared SID requires a
        very early turn it may be necessary to determine and action a strategy when below 400ft. If this is
        the case, it must be thoroughly briefed.</para>

        <para>Once the flight path strategy has been agreed and actioned, the failure can be diagnosed and
        dealt with. If the failure has resulted in an ECAM warning, PF initiates this phase by asking PNF to
        "Read ECAM". Once the ECAM is confirmed, PF will take the radios and request PNF to carry out ECAM
        actions. When applying ECAM procedures, PF is responsible for moving the thrust levers once confirmed
        by PNF. PNF is responsible for everything else, but movement of engine master switches, IR selectors
        and any guarded switch must be confirmed with PF.</para>

          <title>EOSID and 3 segment climb</title>

          <para>Before the divergence point (the last common point between the SID and the EOSID), if the
          aircraft detects a loss of thrust the EOSID will be displayed as a temporary flight plan. In this
          case the temporary flight plan can be inserted and NAV mode used. Otherwise it will be necessary to
          pull heading and manually follow either the yellow line or bring up a pre-prepared secondary flight
          plan and follow the white line.</para>

          <para>If beyond the divergence point, pull heading and make an <emphasis>immediate</emphasis> turn
          the shortest way onto the EOSID. Airbus specifically recommends against this in FCOM 4.4.30, but
          easyJet states it as policy in EOMB 4.2.3.</para>

          <para>Electing to fly the EOSID implies a three segment vertical strategy:

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>Segment 1 is a TOGA climb at the higher of V<subscript>2</subscript> or current
            speed, up to a limit of V<subscript>2</subscript>+15kt. If a FLEX takeoff was carried out, a FLEX
            climb is permissable. This segment is continued until all high priority tasks are complete and the
            aircraft is at or above acceleration altitude. For the engine failure and the engine fire failure
            cases, EOMB 4.2.3 defines these high priority tasks. For an engine failure, all ECAM actions up to
            and including the master switch being turned off must be completed. For the engine fire case all
            ECAM actions up to and including firing the first squib must be completed. If the fire warning
            light does not extinguish both squibs must be fired.</para></listitem>

            <listitem><para>Segment 2 is a TOGA level acceleration and clean up, either to Conf 1 and S speed
            if an immediate VMC return is desired or to Conf 0 and green dot. Again FLEX may be used if a FLEX
            takeoff was carried out. Level acceleration is usually acheived by pushing V/S.  The phrases "Stop
            ECAM" and "Continue ECAM" can be used to interupt ECAM procedures in order to initiate this
            segment.</para></listitem>

            <listitem><para>Segment 3 is a MCT climb segment to MSA, either at S speed if in Conf 1 or at
            green dot speed if in Conf 0. This is usually acheived in open climb.</para></listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          TOGA may be used for a maximum of 10 minutes.</para>

      <title>Emergency descent <emphasis>(memory item)</emphasis></title>
      <para>[EOM B.3.2.80, QRH 1.25, FCOM 3.2.80.4000]</para>
      
      <para>If an emergency descent is required, the Captain should consider taking control if not already PF.</para>

      <para>Don oxygen masks, set them to the N position and establish communication.</para>
      
      <para>Descent with autopilot and autothrottle engaged is preferred. The configuration is thrust idle, full speed
      brake and maximum appropriate speed, taking into account possible structural damage. Target altitude is FL100 or
      MORA if this is higher. If speed is low, allow speed to increase before deploying full speedbrake to prevent
      activation of the angle of attack protection. Landing gear may be used below 25,000ft, but speed must be below
      V<subscript>LE</subscript> when it is extended and remain below V<subscript>LO</subscript>. If on an airway,
      consider turning 90° to the left.</para>

      <para>PNF should, from memory, turn seatbelt signs on, set continuous ignition on the engines, set 7700 on the
      transponder and inform ATC of the descent. If cabin altitude will exceed 14,000ft, he should also deploy the cabin
      oxygen masks.</para>

      <para>Once the memory actions are complete and the aircraft is descending, PF should finesse the target altitude,
      speed and heading. He should then take over communications and call for the emergency descent checklist. Once this is
      complete, the Captain should make the following PA:
        <blockquote><para>"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the Captain. We have lost cabin pressure and are descending to a lower
        altitude. Put your oxygen masks on and obey the instructions of the cabin crew"</para></blockquote></para>

        <para>Once level, restore the aircraft to a normal configuration. When safe to do so, advise cabin crew and
        passengers that it is safe to remove their masks.</para>

        <title>Windshear <emphasis>(memory item)</emphasis></title>
        <sect3>
          <title>Reactive</title>
          <para>[FCOM 3.2.80.13000]</para>

          <para>The windshear detection system is a function of the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC). It only operates
          during the takeoff and landing phases with at least CONF 1 selected. In the takeoff phase, warnings are
          provided from 3 seconds after lift off until 1300ft RA is acheived. In the landing phase warnings are provided
          between 1300ft RA and 50ft RA. A warning is indicated by a red "WINDSHEAR" flag on the PFD and a "WINDSHEAR,
          WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR" aural warning.</para>

          <para>When on the ground, windshear is <emphasis>only</emphasis> indicated by significant airspeed
          variations. It is possible that these fluctuations may cause V1 to occur significantly later in the takeoff
          run then it should. It therefore falls to the Captain to make an assessment of whether sufficient runway
          remains to reject the takeoff, or whether getting airborne below V<subscript>r</subscript> would be the better
          option. If the takeoff is to be continued in windshear conditions, call "Windshear, TOGA" and apply TOGA
          power.  Rotate at V<subscript>r</subscript> or with sufficient runway remaining and follow SRS orders. {TODO:
          This is Boeing advice - Airbus offers no advice if there is insufficient runway available to rotate at normal
          speeds}. SRS will maintain a minimum rate of climb, even if airspeed must be sacrificed.</para>

          <para>If a warning occurs when airborne, call "Windshear, TOGA", apply TOGA power and maintain current
          configuration. The autopilot can fly the escape maneuvre as long as
          &alpha;<subscript>req</subscript>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&alpha;<subscript>prot</subscript>. If the autopilot is not
          engaged, follow the SRS orders on the FD. If the FD is not available, initially pitch up to 17.5°, then
          increase as required.</para>

          <para>In severe windshear, it is possible that ALPHA FLOOR protection will activate. As TOGA will
          already be selected, this will have no immediate effect. Once clear of the windshear, however, TOGA
          LK will be active, requiring the autothrust to be disconnected to avoid an overspeed.</para>

          <title>Predictive</title>
          <para>[FCOM 3.2.80.14000, FCOM 3.4.91]</para>

          <para>When below 2300ft AGL, the weather radar scans a 5nm radius 60° arc ahead of the aircraft for returns
          indicating potential windshear.</para>

          <para>Alerts are categorised as advisory, caution or warning, in increasing order of severity. Severity is
          determined by range, position and phase of flight. Alerts are only provided when between 50ft and 1500ft, or
          on the ground when below 100kt.</para>

          <para>All types of alert produce an indication of windshear position on the ND, providing the ND range is set
          to 10nm. A message on the ND instructs the crew to change range to 10nm if not already set. Cautions also give
          an amber "W/S AHEAD" message on both PFDs and an aural "MONITOR RADAR DISPLAY" warning. Warnings give a red
          "W/S AHEAD" message on the PFDs and either a "WINDSHEAR AHEAD, WINDSHEAR AHEAD" or "GO AROUND, WINDSHEAR
          AHEAD" aural message.</para>

          <para>If a warning alert occurs during the takeoff roll, reject the takeoff. If it occurs during initial
          climb, call "Windshear, TOGA", apply TOGA thrust and follow SRS orders. Configuration may be changed as long
          as the windshear is not entered.</para>

          <para>If a warning alert occurs during approach, carry out a normal go-around. If positive verification is
          made that no hazard exists, the crew may downgrade the warning to a caution. If a caution alert occurs during
          approach, consider use of CONF 3 and increasing V<subscript>APP</subscript> to a maximum of
          V<subscript>LS</subscript>+15.</para>

        <title>Unreliable airspeed <emphasis>(memory item)</emphasis></title>

        <para>[QRH 2.15, FCOM 3.2.34.30000]</para>

        <para>Unreliable airspeed indications may result from radome damage and/or unserviceable probes or
        ports. Altitude indications may also be erroneous if static probes are affected.</para>

        <para>The FMGCs normally reject erroneous ADR data by isolating a single source that has significant differences
        to the other two sources. It is possible that a single remaining good source may be rejected if the other two
        sources are erroneous in a sufficiently similar way. In this case, it falls to the pilots to identify and turn
        off the erroneous sources to recover good data.</para>

        <para>The first problem is recognition of a failure, since the aircraft systems may be unable to warn of a
        problem. The primary method of doing this is correlation of aircraft attitude and thrust to displayed
        performance. Correlation of radio altimeter and GPIRS derived data (available on GPS MONITOR page) may also aid
        identification. The stall warning (available in alternate or direct law) is based on alpha probes, so will
        likely be valid. Other clues may include fluctuations in readings, abnormal behavior of the automatics, high
        speed buffet or low aerodynamic noise.</para>

        <para>If the aircraft flight path is in doubt, disconnect the automatics and fly the following short term
        attitude and thrust settings to initiate a climb:

        <informaltable>

        Flap configuration should be maintained except when a go-around is initiated with flap full, in which case CONF
        3 should be selected. The gear and speedbrake should be retracted. If there is any doubt over the validity of
        altitude information, the FPV must be disregarded. If altitude information is definitely good, the FPV may be
        used.</para>

        <para>Once the flight path is under control and a safe altitude is attained, refer to the table on page 2.15 of
        the QRH to extract a pitch and thrust combination for your weight and configuration. Speed should be adjusted
        until the aircraft flies level with these parameters set. Level flight can be established using the VSI, which
        is an inertial instrument unless there is there is an amber box around the numerical indication on the V/S scale
        {TODO: Confirm this - QRH indicates that VSI should not be used if altitude is in doubt}. Once stabilised, an
        attempt should be made to recover good data by switching off faulty ADRs.</para>

        <para>If good ADR information cannot be recovered, tables are provided on page 2.17 and 2.18 of the QRH to
        enable all phases of flight to be flown using just pitch and thrust settings. The approach configuration should
        be flown in level flight, stabilising each configuration before the next configuration is selected.</para>

        <para>Evacuation should be carried out in accordance with the emergency evacuation checklist. The easyJet
        procedure is for CM1 to call for the checklist and then send a Mayday message to ATC before commencing the

        <para>The next four items prepare the aircraft for evacuation. If manual cabin pressure has been used, CM2
        checks cabin diff is zero, and if necessary manually opens the outflow valve. CM2 then shuts the engines down
        with their master switches, and pushes all the fire buttons (including the APU). Confirmation is not required
        before carrying out these actions {TODO: This is not clear from EOM B, but incorporates the FCTM
        instruction}. CM1 does, however, respond "Confirmed" in response to the checklist items once they have been
        actioned. In response to the next checklist item, "Agents", CM1 decides if any extinguishing agents should be
        discharged and instructs CM2 to discharge them as required. Engine agent 2 will not be available. Agents should
        only be discharged if there are positive signs of fire.</para>

        <para>A landing can be made at any weight, providing sufficient landing distance is available. Automatic
        landings are certified up to MLW, but flight tests have demonstrated autoland capability to 69000kg in case of

        QRH/ECAM procedures or if aircraft weight exceeds the CONF&nbsp;3 go around limit (see QRH 2.25). Packs should be
        turned off to provide additional go around thrust. If configuration is less than FULL, use 1+F for
        go-around.</para>

        <para>It is possible that S speed will be higher than V<subscript>FE&nbsp;next</subscript> for CONF 2. In this case,
        a speed below V<subscript>FE&nbsp;next</subscript> should be selected until CONF 2 is acheived, then managed speed

        <para>Set MCT on live engine then disconnect the autothrust. Start ECAM actions and notify ATC. Decide on
        strategy - standard strategy increases the chance of an engine relight, whilst obstacle strategy maintains the
        greatest possible obstacle clearance. If using standard strategy select speed .78/300kt. If using obstacle
        strategy select green dot speed. Select altitude to LRC ceiling or green dot ceiling as appropriate to allow
        drift down once speed is reached. If obstacles remain a problem, MCT and green dot speed can be maintained to
        give a shallow climbing profile. Once obstacles are no longer a problem, descend to LRC ceiling (use V/S if
        &lt;500 fpm descent rate), engage the autothrust and continue at LRC speed.

        interupt the power supply, wait 3 seconds (5 seconds if a C/B was used), restore the power, then wait another
        three seconds for the reset to complete. Specific procedures are detailed in the computer reset tables on page
        2.36 of the QRH.</para>

        <para>On the ground, almost all computers can be reset. The exceptions are the ECU and EIU while the associated

        <para>There is no ECAM in the case of total loss of pressure control leading to an overpressure, so apply the

        and the remaining pack is turned off if it exceeds 9 psi. 10 minutes before landing, both packs are turned off
        and remain off, and the avionics ventilation is returned to its normal configuration.</para>

        <para>[QRH 2.03, FCOM 1.27.50.3000, FCOM 3.2.27.{1,2,3,4}000, amber ECAM:<emphasis
        role="underline">F/CTL</emphasis> FLAPS(SLATS) FAULT(LOCKED)</para>

        <para>The most pressing concern following a flap or slat problem is to establish a max operating speed that will
        avoid overspeeding the device in its locked position. A table is provided on page 2.05 of the QRH for this
        purpose, but a quick estimation can be made by establishing what flap lever position would be required to get
        the device into its current position and using V<subscript>FE</subscript> for the configuration associated with
        that flap lever position as V<subscript>MO</subscript>. In doing this, it must be remembered that slat
        deployment in CONF 2 and CONF 3 is the same (tip: think of available slat positions as being 0, 1, Intermediate
        or Full). The barber's pole displayed for V<subscript>FE</subscript> on the PFD is a function of the flap lever
        position, so it may be worth initially selecting the flap lever to the matching CONF to have this reference
        available. For minimum speeds, the V<subscript>LS</subscript> displayed on the PFD is calculated from actual
        flap and slat position and can be trusted.</para>

        <para>Unless there is an obvious reason not to (e.g. wing tip brake on, alignment fault or fault due to dual
        hydraulic failure), the flap lever can then be recycled.</para>

        <para>If normal operation cannot be restored, there are two major issues that must be quickly
        addressed. Firstly, fuel burn will be dramatically higher when flying with a locked device. With slats extended,
        fuel burn will increase by 60%, with flaps extended 80% and with both extended fuel burn will double. The
        paragraph at the bottom of page 2.05 of the QRH provides these figures. The second issue is that landing
        distances are significantly increased, in the worst case by a factor of 2.2. Landing distance can be assessed
        using the tables on page 2.32 and 4.03 of the QRH. It may be that the combination of these factors requires a
        fairly prompt diversion decision.</para>

        <para>The flap and slat systems are largely independent, so the flap lever will continue to move the slats if
        the flaps are locked and vice versa. In general, flap 3 should be selected for landing. There are two
        exceptions. If flaps are locked at &gt;3, flap full should be used. If both slats and flaps are locked at 0,
        flap 1 should be used so that the AP/FD go-around is armed. Configurations and V<subscript>REF</subscript>
        increments are available on page 2.32 of the QRH. If a flapless and slatless landing is required, the threshold
        speed in may be below V<subscript>LS</subscript>. This is necessary as the landing speeds in this configuration
        are very close to tyre limit speeds.</para>

        <para>During configuration, V<subscript>LS</subscript> is computed from actual configuration and V<subscript>FE
        next</subscript> is computed from flap lever position. This may lead to a situation where
        V<subscript>LS</subscript>&gt;V<subscript>FE next</subscript>. It is therefore acceptable to set the next flap
        lever position when above V<subscript>FE next</subscript> and reduce the speed to follow
        V<subscript>LS</subscript> as the surfaces extend. Use of managed speed is not recommended during
        configuration.</para>

        <para>The autopilot may be used down to 500ft AAL, but since it is not tuned for the abnormal configuration it
        must be closely monitored.</para>

        <para>For the go-around, initially maintain flap/ slat configuration. A speed 10kt lower than max operating
        speed should be flown. If it is the slats that are jammed or if the flaps are jammed at 0, clean configuration
        can be used to transit to a diversion airfield.</para>

        <para>Other issues include the possible loss of the automatic operation of the centre tank pumps (which
        is sequenced to the slats) and possible reversion to Alternate Law.</para>

        <para>Each SEC controls either 1 or 2 spoilers per wing. SEC 1 and 2 also provide back up for the ELACs (see
        <xref linkend="flight-controls.elac"/>). Loss of a SEC leads to loss of its associated spoilers. SEC 1 provides
        spoiler position to the FACs. If speedbrakes are deployed with SEC 1 u/s and SEC 3 operative, spoiler 2 will
        deploy without a corresponding increase in V<subscript>LS</subscript>. Therefore, do not use speedbrake if SEC 1
        is affected (it won't do much anyway!).</para>

        <para>Pairs of SECs also provide the signal for reverse thrust lever angle to the reversers and spoiler
        deployment to the autobrake. A dual SEC failure will therefore lead to a loss of a reverser and loss of
        autobraking.</para>

        <para>If all SECs are lost, all the above holds true. Furthermore the flight controls revert to Alternate Law
        due to the complete loss of spoilers. Also, due to routing of LGCIU data to the ELACs via the SECs, Direct Law

        up pitch changes so it should be used with care. Protections are unavailable, so speed is limited to 320kt/0.77M

        it may become impossible to carry out this checklist due to smoke density. In this case, interrupt the checklist
        and carry out the smoke removal drill (see <xref linkend="smoke-fumes-removal"/>). It is also possible that the
        situation may deteriorate to a level that an immediate forced landing becomes the preferable option. In general,
        unless the source of the smoke is obvious and extinguishable, a diversion should be initiated immediately. The
        smoke removal drill is most effective and adaptable at lower levels, so a descent to 10,000ft or MSA is also a

        are also likely to occur as sensors detect the smoke in other areas. The displayed ECAM procedures must be
        applied. Following an engine or APU failure, smoke may initially enter the air conditioning system but should
        dissipate quickly once the failure is contained. The air conditioning drill starts by turning the APU bleed off
        in case this is the source. The packs are then turned off one at a time to determine if the source of the smoke

        buses one at a time by preventing bus transfers and turning generators off. This allows significant portions of
        the electrical equipment to be isolated in blocks. Note that if AC bus 1 is shed, the Captain's instruments and
        the STBY instruments are both supplied from non de-iced sensors and should be suspected if there is any
        disagreement. If this does not work, the emergency electrical configuration is adopted (see <xref

        <para>The primary method used to detect fuel leaks is a regular check that actual fuel remaining corresponds to

        <para>If depletion rates are similar, a leak from the center tank or from the APU feeding line should be
        suspected. If there is a smell of fuel in the cabin, it is likely that the APU feeding line is at fault and the
        APU should be turned off. Fuel from the center tank should be used once one of the inner tanks has
        &lt;3000kg. {TODO: I don't understand the logic here - surely an APU feeding line leak would cause the left tank
        to decrease faster than the right, and why not put the center tank pumps in AUTO and use the fuel as soon as
        possible if you suspect a leak from the center tank?}</para>

        <para>If, after 30 minutes, one tank has been depleted by 300kg more than the other, the location of leak is

        If the leak then stops, an engine leak is confirmed and the cross feed can be used. If not, a leak from the wing

        occurs when one inner tank holds &gt;1500kg more than the other. The limitations for fuel imbalance in
        FCOM 3.1.28, however, show that the fuel advisory does not necessarily indicate that a limitation is
        likely to be breached. In particular, when the outer tanks are balanced and the heavier inner tank

        <para>It is recommended that the QRH paper procedure on page 1.16 is used rather than the ECAM.</para>

        <para>First priority, assuming fuel remains, is to attempt a relight by turning the ignitors on and setting the
        thrust levers to idle. The speed should initially be increased to 300kt to increase windmilling and improve the
        chance of a relight. At this speed, the aircraft will cover approximately 2nm for every 1000ft lost. With this
        in mind, a suitable plan should be constructed to cover the possibility that relight is not possible.</para>

        <para>Whilst awaiting a relight, ensure that the emergency electrical generator is on line and recycle FAC1 to
        recover characteristic speed display and rudder trim. For communications, VHF1 and ATC1 are available in the
        emergency electrical config. Due to lack of engine bleeds, a slow depressurisation will be occuring, so be ready
        to don oxygen masks.</para>

        <para>If there has been no relight after 30 seconds, the combustion chambers should be ventilated by turning
        both engine masters off for 30 seconds. Another attempt can then be made by turning them back on. This sequence
        should be repeated until successful or until APU bleed air becomes available at FL200.</para>

        <para>Once below FL250, the APU can be started. Once below FL200, speed should be reduced to green dot and
        assisted starts should be attempted. At green dot speed, 2½nm will be covered for every 1000ft lost. Attempt to
        start one engine at a time in the normal manner.</para>

        <para>If a landing must be made without power, CONF 3 slats are recommended (flaps are
        unavailable). V<subscript>app</subscript> should be V<subscript>ref</subscript>+25kt or 150kt, whichever is
        higher. The gear is available with gravity extension. The stabilizer will be frozen once engine driven
        hydraulics are lost and elevator trimming will cease with transition to direct law at gear extension. Therefore,
        gear extension should be delayed until CONF 3 and V<subscript>app</subscript> are reached. If ditching, do not
        extend the gear.</para>

        <para>If an airfield can be reached, cross the outer marker at twice the normal height with CONF 1, gear up. For
        a clean aircraft, the following rules of thumb apply {TODO: these are Boeing rules - check that they hold for

        <para>A graph showing the in flight relight envelope is provided on page 2.22 of the QRH. The ceiling is 27000
        ft. Automatic start is recommended, but crew action is required in case of abnormal start.</para>

        <para>To prepare for the start, ensure the affected engine master switch is turned off and the affected thrust
        lever is at idle. Select ignition on the engine mode selector and open the cross bleed. If it is anticipated
        starter assist may be required, ensure wing anti ice is selected off.</para>

        <para>To begin the start sequence, select the affected master switch on. The FADEC will determine whether
        starter assist is required and will open the start valve as needed. Both ignitors are energised as soon as the
        master switch is turned on, and the HP fuel valve opens at 15% N2. Closure of the start valve and
        de-energisation of the ignitors occurs at 50% N2 as normal. Light off must occur within 30 seconds of fuel flow
        initiation. If uncertain about successful relight, move the thrust lever to check for engine response. The START
        FAULT ENG STALL ECAM may be disregarded if all other parameters are normal. </para>

        <para>A stall is indicated by abnormal engine noise, flame from the engine exhaust (and possibly inlet in
        extreme cases), fluctuating performance parameters, sluggish thrust lever response, high EGT and/ or rapid EGT
        rise when the thrust lever is advanced. The ECAM warning will be triggered when N2 is between 50% and idle. If
        N2 is above idle, the QRH should be used.</para>

        <para>The ECAM simply instructs the master switch to be turned off, and then secures the engine using the after
        engine shut down procedure (see <xref linkend="engine-shut-down"/>). This procedure should also be followed if a
        stall occurs on the ground.</para>

        <para>In flight, if no ECAM is triggered, the affected thrust lever should be retarded to idle. If the engine
        parameters remain abnormal, shut the engine down with the master switch. If the parameters are normal, turn on
        all the anti-icing to increase bleed demand {TODO: This is inferred - check it} and slowly advance the thrust
        lever. If the stall recurs, the engine can be operated at low thrust settings, otherwise it can be operated
        normally.</para>

        <title>Engine tailpipe fire</title>
        <para>[QRH 2.23, FCOM 3.2.70.62000, reverse side of normal checklist]</para>

        <para>An internal engine fire may be encountered during engine start or shutdown. It will either be seen by
        ground crew or may be indicated by EGT failing to decrease after the master switch is selected off.</para>

        <para>Start by getting the engine to a known state by ensuring the man start button is selected off and the
        affected engine master is selected off.</para>

        <para>The concept is to blow the fire out by dry cranking the engine. It is therefore essential that the fire
        button is <emphasis>not</emphasis> pressed, as this will remove external power from the FADEC and prevent dry
        cranking. Firstly, a source of bleed air must be available to power the starter. Possibilities, in order of
        preference, are the APU, the opposite engine or a ground air cart. If using the opposite engine, the source
        engine bleed must be on, the target engine bleed should be off, the cross bleed should be opened and thrust
        increased to provide 30 psi of pressure. {TODO: This is just the crossbleed start procedure from 3.4.70.4000 -
        check that there are no differences}. If using ground air, both engine bleeds should be off and the cross bleed
        opened. Once high pressure air is available, select the engine mode selector to crank and select the man start
        button to on. Once the fire is extinguished, select the man start button off and the engine mode selector to
        normal.</para>

        <para>As a last resort, external fire suppression agents may be used. They are, however, highly corrosive and
        the engine will be a write off.</para>

        <para>If in icing conditions, high engine vibration may be due to fan blade or spinner icing. The QRH provides a
        drill to shed this ice, after which normal operations can be resumed.</para>

        <para>This ECAM warning indicates that an engine master switch is off between the start of the takeoff roll and
        the completion of the landing roll, or that a fire button has been pushed in the other phases. It deals with the
        subsequent issues arising from single engine operation.</para>

        <para>The most pressing issue is that a single engine cannot support wing anti-ice and two packs, so if wing
        anti-ice is in use, one of the packs must be turned off. This will generally be the pack on the affected side,
        but will need to be pack 1 in electrical emergency configuration. The cross bleed must be opened for symmetrical
        wing anti-icing. If a fire button has been pushed, the cross bleed cannot be opened, and wing anti-ice is
        unavailable.</para>

        <para>The remaining engine must be safeguarded. To this end, continuous ignition should be selected.</para>

        <para>A fuel imbalance may develop. Fuel imbalance limitations are detailed in FCOM 3.1.28, but an inner tank
        imbalance of &lt;1500kg will never be limiting if the outer tanks are balanced. Fuel may still need to be
        crossfed to prevent fuel starvation of the remaining engine. {TODO: Where is the cross feed procedure?}</para>

        <para>EPGWS alerts can be categorised into warnings and cautions. A warning is any alert with the instruction
        "Pull up" attached. All other alerts are cautions. A warning may be downgraded to a caution if flying in
        daylight VMC and positive visual verification is made that no hazard exists [EOM-A 8.3.5].</para>

        <para>The response to a warning is to call "Pull up, TOGA", disconnect the autopilot and simultaneously roll the
        wings level, apply full backstick and set TOGA power. The speedbrake should then be checked retracted. Once the
        flight path is safe and the warning stops, accelerate and clean up as required.</para>

        <para>TCAS warnings may be either traffic advisories ("Traffic, Traffic") or resolution advisories (anything
        else). The first response to either advisory is to call "TCAS, I have control" to unequivocally establish who
        will be carrying out any maneuvers. If it is a resolution advisory, the autopilot should be disconnected and the
        flight directors turned off. The autothrottle remains engaged and reverts to speed mode. A vertical maneuver
        should then be flown to keep the V/S needle out of the red areas shown on the V/S scale. ATC should then be
        notified (e.g "Radar, Easy 123 - TCAS climb"). When clear of conflict, negotiate a new clearance with ATC and
        re-engage the automatics.</para>

        <para>[EOM A.8.3.2, EOM B.2.4.51]</para>

        <para>If an ECAM or MCDU message indicates navigation accuracy is compromised whilst flying in RNP-5 (BRNAV)
        airspace, a navigation check should be made using the GPS MONITOR page or raw radio aid data. If a single FMGC
        is at fault, navigation can be continued using the other FMGC. If RNP-5 ability has been lost, inform ATC and
        continue with conventional navigation. The IRS provides RNP-5 required accuracy for two hours from last
        alignment regardless of MCDU ENP.</para>

        <para>In an RNP-1 (PRNAV) environment, loss of navigation accuracy may be more serious as the aircraft may be
        below MSA when it occurs. The initial response is to notify ATC with the phrase "Unable RNAV due equipment" and
        request reclearance. It is important to be aware that terrain clearance may be compromised, so an immediate
        climb above MSA should be considered if a suitable alternative navigation method (e.g. radar vectors) is not
        available.</para>

        <para>In general, an RNP-1 approach only requires the availability of a single RNAV system consisting of one
        FMGC, one MCDU, one sensor (GPS, VOR or DME), one IRS and one FD in NAV mode. GPS PRIMARY is not normally a
        requirement, but if it is not available ensure that RNP is set to 1, NAV ACCURACY is high and a raw data check
        is carried out prior to commencement of the procedure.</para>

        <para>Some RNP-1 procedures include extra restrictions such as the mandatory use of GPS or the availability of
        two RNAV systems. If a failure occurs that breaches one of these restrictions, procede as for a loss of

        be required to restore transponder. If ADR 1 and 3 are lost, the landing gear safety valve is controlled closed,
        so the gear must be gravity extended and cannot subsequently be retracted.</para>

        <para>Loss of all ADRs requires reversion to standby instruments. There is no ECAM procedure - the procedure

        Alternate Law and hence loss of autopilots. Whilst the autothrust is available, it should be disconnected early
        in the approach as it is not able to cope with the quantity of failed systems. The gear should be gravity
        extended (hence Direct Law) at 200kt in order to improve contollability with the single elevator. The speed
        brake should not be used since the differential spoilers are required for roll control. Due to the single

        <para>A known problem with the A319 is that the load on a single bleed supplying two packs at high altitude may
        be sufficient to cause it to trip off. In this case, turning off one pack may allow a bleed reset.</para>

        <para>There is no ECAM associated with a dual bleed failure. The QRH 2.02 procedure applies both to the case
        where the aircraft has dispatched with an inoperative bleed IAW MEL, and in the case where an in-flight failure
        has left a single bleed remaining.</para>

        <para>In the case of an isolated bleed duct (due bleed air leak, engine fire or failed open start valve), the
        bleed associated with the duct is clearly unrecoverable. Since the remaining bleed would only have been
        supplying a single pack, the overload case does not apply. Hence, this bleed is also considered unrecoverable,
        and a bleed reset should not be attempted. If, on the other hand, both ducts are available and a single bleed
        has been supplying two packs, an overload may be suspected and an attempt can be made to reset the overloaded
        bleed once one of the packs is turned off.</para>

        <para>If an engine bleed cannot be recovered, providing #1 bleed duct is available, the APU bleed may be used to
