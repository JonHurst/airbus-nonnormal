      <title>Rejected Takeoff</title>

      <para>The decision to reject rests solely with CM1. This decision is communicated with the words "Stop" or
      "Continue". "Stop" implies that CM1 is taking control of the aircraft. Below 100kt the RTO is relatively risk free
      and a decision to stop should be made for any ECAM and most other problems. Above 100kt the RTO may be hazardous
      and stopping should only be considered for loss of engine thrust, any fire warning, any uninhibited ECAM or
      anything which indicates the aircraft will be unsafe or unable to fly.</para>

      <para>If a stop is required, CM1 calls "Stop" while simultaneously bringing the thrust levers to idle, then to max
      reverse. If the stop was commenced below 72kt the ground spoilers will not automatically deploy and the autobrake
      will therefore not engage. Monitor automatic braking, and if there is any doubt, apply manual braking as
      required. If normal braking fails, announce "Loss of braking" and proceed with the loss of braking memory items
      (see <xref linkend="loss-of-braking"/>). If the reason for the stop was an engine fire on the upwind side,
      consider turning the aircraft to keep the fire away from the fuselage. If there is any chance of requiring
      evacuation, bring the aircraft to a complete halt, stow the reversers, apply the parking brake, and order
      "Attention, crew at stations" on the PA. If evacuation will definitely not be required, once the aircraft's safety
      is assured the RTO can be discontinued and the runway cleared. In this case make a PA of "Cabin crew, normal
      operations".</para>

      <para>During this initial phase, CM2 confirms reverse ("Reverse green"), confirms deceleration ("Decel"), cancels
      any audio warnings, informs ATC and announces "70 knots" when appropriate. CM2 then locates the emergency
      evacuation checklist.</para>

      <para>Once the aircraft has stopped, CM1 takes the radios and asks CM2 to carry out any required ECAM
      actions. Whilst the ECAM actions are being completed, CM1 will build up a decision as to whether to evacuate. If
      an evacuation is required see <xref linkend="evacuation"/>. Otherwise order "Cabin crew, normal
      operations".</para>

      <para>If the aircraft has come to a complete halt using autobrake MAX, the brakes can be released by disarming the
      spoilers.</para>

        <title>Failures during takeoff when above V1</title>

        <para>If an engine has lost thrust, apply rudder conventionally on the runway. At
        V<subscript>r</subscript> rotate to 12½° at a slightly reduced rate. When airborne, select
        TOGA (FLX may be used but this tends to allow speed to decay unless pitch is reduced),
        adjust and trim rudder to maintain &beta; target and request "pull heading". If the EOSID
        follows the track of the cleared SID, NAV may be used, but this is very rare with easyJet
        EOSIDs. Bank angle should be limited to 15° when more than 3kt below maneuvering speed for
        the current configuration. Engage the autopilot once gear is up and rudder is
        trimmed.</para>

        <para>Whilst below 400ft, the only failure related actions should be:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>If applicable, PNF should announce "Engine failure" or "Engine fire" without specifying an
          engine.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>Cancellation of master warning or master caution when both pilots confirm they are aware of
          it.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>Heightened awareness of the possibility of missing essential normal actions, such as calling
          rotate or raising the gear due to the distraction of the failure.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>Once above 400ft with safe flight path assured, decide on an initial strategy. In
        general, where a loss of thrust has occured or is anticipated, the strategy will be to fly
        the EOSID with a level acceleration segment (see <xref linkend="eosid"/>). Otherwise, it
        will be to remain on the normal SID and fly a normal climb profile. Any deviation from the
        cleared SID will require ATC to be informed as a priority, usually as part of a PAN or
        MAYDAY message. In rare cases where the cleared SID requires a very early turn it may be
        necessary to determine and action a strategy when below 400ft. If this is the case, it must
        be thoroughly briefed.</para>

        <para>Once the flight path strategy has been agreed and actioned, the failure can be diagnosed and
        dealt with. If the failure has resulted in an ECAM warning, PF initiates this phase by asking PNF to
        "Read ECAM". Once the ECAM is confirmed, PF will take the radios and request PNF to carry out ECAM
        actions. When applying ECAM procedures, PF is responsible for moving the thrust levers once confirmed
        by PNF. PNF is responsible for everything else, but movement of engine master switches, IR selectors
        and any guarded switch must be confirmed with PF.</para>

        <sect1 id="eosid">
          <title>EOSID</title>

          <para>Before the divergence point (the last common point between the SID and the EOSID), if the
          aircraft detects a loss of thrust the EOSID will be displayed as a temporary flight plan. In this
          case the temporary flight plan can be inserted and NAV mode used. Otherwise it will be necessary to
          pull heading and manually follow either the yellow line or bring up a pre-prepared secondary flight
          plan and follow the white line.</para>

          <para>If beyond the divergence point, pull heading and make an <emphasis>immediate</emphasis> turn
          the shortest way onto the EOSID. Airbus specifically recommends against this in FCOM 4.4.30, but
          easyJet states it as policy in EOMB 4.2.3.</para>

          <para>Electing to fly the EOSID implies a level acceleration segment:

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>Initially fly a TOGA climb at the higher of V<subscript>2</subscript> or current
            speed, up to a limit of V<subscript>2</subscript>+15kt. If a FLEX takeoff was carried out, a FLEX
            climb is permissable. This climb is continued until all high priority tasks are complete and the
            aircraft is at or above acceleration altitude. For the engine failure and the engine fire
            cases, EOMB 4.2.3 specifically defines the high priority tasks. For an engine failure, all ECAM actions up to
            and including the master switch being turned off must be completed. For the engine fire case all
            ECAM actions up to and including firing the first squib must be completed. If the fire warning
            light does not extinguish both squibs must be fired.</para></listitem>

            <listitem><para>The next segment is a TOGA level acceleration and clean up, either to Conf 1 and S speed
            if an immediate VMC return is desired or to Conf 0 and green dot. Again FLEX may be used if a FLEX
            takeoff was carried out. Level acceleration is usually acheived by pushing V/S.  The phrases "Stop
            ECAM" and "Continue ECAM" can be used to interupt ECAM procedures in order to initiate this
            segment.</para></listitem>

            <listitem><para>The final segment is a MCT climb segment to MSA, either at S speed if in Conf 1 or at
            green dot speed if in Conf 0. This is usually acheived in open climb.</para></listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          TOGA may be used for a maximum of 10 minutes.</para>

      <title>Emergency descent <emphasis>(memory item)</emphasis></title>

      <para>If an emergency descent is required, the Captain should consider taking control if not already PF.</para>

      <para>Don oxygen masks, set them to the N position and establish communication.</para>

      <para>Descent with autopilot and autothrottle engaged is preferred. The configuration is thrust idle, full speed
      brake and maximum appropriate speed, taking into account possible structural damage. Target altitude is FL100 or
      MORA if this is higher. If speed is low, allow speed to increase before deploying full speedbrake to prevent
      activation of the angle of attack protection. Landing gear may be used below 25,000ft, but speed must be below
      V<subscript>LE</subscript> when it is extended and remain below V<subscript>LO</subscript>. If on an airway,
      consider turning 90° to the left.</para>

      <para>PNF should, from memory, turn seatbelt signs on, set continuous ignition on the engines, set 7700 on the
      transponder and inform ATC of the descent. If cabin altitude will exceed 14,000ft, he should also deploy the cabin
      oxygen masks.</para>

      <para>Once the memory actions are complete and the aircraft is descending, PF should finesse the target altitude,
      speed and heading. He should then take over communications and call for the emergency descent checklist. Once this is
      complete, the Captain should make the following PA:
        <blockquote><para>"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the Captain. We have lost cabin pressure and are descending to a lower
        altitude. Put your oxygen masks on and obey the instructions of the cabin crew"</para></blockquote></para>

        <para>Once level, restore the aircraft to a normal configuration. When safe to do so, advise cabin crew and
        passengers that it is safe to remove their masks.</para>

        <title>Windshear <emphasis>(memory item)</emphasis></title>
        <sect2>
          <title>Reactive</title>

          <para>The windshear detection system is a function of the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC). It only operates
          during the takeoff and landing phases with at least CONF 1 selected. In the takeoff phase, warnings are
          provided from 3 seconds after lift off until 1300ft RA is acheived. In the landing phase warnings are provided
          between 1300ft RA and 50ft RA. A warning is indicated by a red "WINDSHEAR" flag on the PFD and a "WINDSHEAR,
          WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR" aural warning.</para>

          <para>When on the ground, windshear is <emphasis>only</emphasis> indicated by significant airspeed
          variations. It is possible that these fluctuations may cause V1 to occur significantly later in the takeoff
          run then it should. It therefore falls to the Captain to make an assessment of whether sufficient runway
          remains to reject the takeoff, or whether getting airborne below V<subscript>r</subscript> would be the better
          option. If the takeoff is to be continued in windshear conditions, call "Windshear, TOGA" and apply TOGA
          power.  Rotate at V<subscript>r</subscript> or with sufficient runway remaining and follow SRS orders. {TODO:
          This is Boeing advice - Airbus offers no advice if there is insufficient runway available to rotate at normal
          speeds}. SRS will maintain a minimum rate of climb, even if airspeed must be sacrificed.</para>

          <para>If a warning occurs when airborne, call "Windshear, TOGA", apply TOGA power and maintain current
          configuration. The autopilot can fly the escape maneuvre as long as
          &alpha;<subscript>req</subscript>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&alpha;<subscript>prot</subscript>. If the autopilot is not
          engaged, follow the SRS orders on the FD. If the FD is not available, initially pitch up to 17.5°, then
          increase as required.</para>

          <para>In severe windshear, it is possible that ALPHA FLOOR protection will activate. As TOGA will
          already be selected, this will have no immediate effect. Once clear of the windshear, however, TOGA
          LK will be active, requiring the autothrust to be disconnected to avoid an overspeed.</para>

          <title>Predictive</title>

          <para>When below 2300ft AGL, the weather radar scans a 5nm radius 60° arc ahead of the aircraft for returns
          indicating potential windshear.</para>

          <para>Alerts are categorised as advisory, caution or warning, in increasing order of severity. Severity is
          determined by range, position and phase of flight. Alerts are only provided when between 50ft and 1500ft, or
          on the ground when below 100kt.</para>

          <para>All types of alert produce an indication of windshear position on the ND, providing the ND range is set
          to 10nm. A message on the ND instructs the crew to change range to 10nm if not already set. Cautions also give
          an amber "W/S AHEAD" message on both PFDs and an aural "MONITOR RADAR DISPLAY" warning. Warnings give a red
          "W/S AHEAD" message on the PFDs and either a "WINDSHEAR AHEAD, WINDSHEAR AHEAD" or "GO AROUND, WINDSHEAR
          AHEAD" aural message.</para>

          <para>If a warning alert occurs during the takeoff roll, reject the takeoff. If it occurs during initial
          climb, call "Windshear, TOGA", apply TOGA thrust and follow SRS orders. Configuration may be changed as long
          as the windshear is not entered.</para>

          <para>If a warning alert occurs during approach, carry out a normal go-around. If positive verification is
          made that no hazard exists, the crew may downgrade the warning to a caution. If a caution alert occurs during
          approach, consider use of CONF 3 and increasing V<subscript>APP</subscript> to a maximum of
          V<subscript>LS</subscript>+15.</para>

      <sect1 id="unreliable-airspeed">
        <title>Unreliable airspeed <emphasis>(memory item)</emphasis></title>

        <para>Unreliable airspeed indications may result from radome damage and/or unserviceable
        probes or ports. Altitude indications may also be erroneous if static probes are
        affected.</para>

        <para>The FMGCs normally reject erroneous ADR data by isolating a single source that has
        significant differences to the other two sources. It is possible that a single remaining
        good source may be rejected if the other two sources are erroneous in a sufficiently similar
        way. In this case, it falls to the pilots to identify and turn off the erroneous sources to
        recover good data.</para>

        <para>The first problem is recognition of a failure, since the aircraft systems may be
        unable to warn of a problem. The primary method of doing this is correlation of aircraft
        attitude and thrust to displayed performance. Correlation of radio altimeter and GPIRS
        derived data (available on GPS MONITOR page) may also aid identification. The stall warning
        (available in alternate or direct law) is based on alpha probes, so will likely be
        valid. Other clues may include fluctuations in readings, abnormal behavior of the
        automatics, high speed buffet or low aerodynamic noise.</para>

        <para>If the aircraft flight path is in doubt, disconnect the automatics and fly the
        following short term attitude and thrust settings to initiate a climb:

        Flap configuration should be maintained except when a go-around is initiated with flap full,
        in which case CONF 3 should be selected. The gear and speedbrake should be retracted. If
        there is any doubt over the validity of altitude information, the FPV must be
        disregarded. If altitude information is definitely good, the FPV may be used.</para>

        <para>Once the flight path is under control and a safe altitude is attained, the aircraft
        should be transitioned into level flight. Refer to QRH 2.15 to extract a ballpark thrust
        setting, a reference attitude and a reference speed for the current configuration, bearing
        in mind that an auto-retraction of the flap may have occurred. Set the ballpark thrust
        setting and adjust pitch attitude to fly level; if barometric altitude data is considered
        accurate use the VSI, otherwise fly a constant GPS altitude. The thrust should then be
        adjusted until level flight is achieved with the reference attitude. Note that in the radome
        damage case, the required N1 may be as much as 5% greater than the ballpark figure. Once
        stable, the speed will be equal to the reference speed.</para>

	<para>If there is insufficient data available to fly level (e.g. GPS data unavailable and
	barometric data unreliable), fly the reference attitude with the ballpark thrust
	setting. This will give approximately level flight at approximately reference speed.</para>

	<para>With the speed now known, the ADRs can be checked to see if any are giving accurate
	data. If at least one ADR is reliable, turn off the faulty ADRs. GPS and IRS ground speeds
	may also be used for an approximate cross check.</para>

        <para>If all ADRs are considered unreliable, turn off any two of them; one is kept on to
        provide stall warning from the alpha probes. Tables are provided on page 2.17 and 2.18 of
        the QRH to enable all phases of flight to be flown using just pitch and thrust
        settings. Acceleration and clean up are carried out in level flight. Flap 1 can be selected
        as soon as climb thrust is selected, flap 0 once the S speed pitch attitudes in the table on
        QRH 2.15 are reached. Configuration for approach is also carried out in level flight,
        stabilising in each configuration using the technique described above. The approach is flown
        in CONF 3 at an attitude that should result in VLS+10 when flying a 3° glide. Landing
        distance will be increased.</para>

        <title>Evacuation</title>

        <para>Evacuation should be carried out in accordance with the emergency evacuation checklist. The easyJet
        procedure is for CM1 to call for the checklist and then send a Mayday message to ATC before commencing the
        checklist. {TODO: this strikes me as a bit of an odd order to do things - check its correct}</para>

        <para>The first two items confirm the RTO actions of stopping the aircraft, setting the parking brake and
        alerting the cabin crew. The next item confirms ATC has been alerted.</para>

        <para>The next four items prepare the aircraft for evacuation. If manual cabin pressure has been used, CM2
        checks cabin diff is zero, and if necessary manually opens the outflow valve. CM2 then shuts the engines down
        with their master switches, and pushes all the fire buttons (including the APU). Confirmation is not required
        before carrying out these actions {TODO: This is not clear from EOM B, but incorporates the FCTM
        instruction}. CM1 does, however, respond "Confirmed" in response to the checklist items once they have been
        actioned. In response to the next checklist item, "Agents", CM1 decides if any extinguishing agents should be
        discharged and instructs CM2 to discharge them as required. Engine agent 2 will not be available. Agents should
        only be discharged if there are positive signs of fire.</para>

        emergency. The preferred landing configuration is CONF&nbsp;FULL, but lower settings may be used if required by
        QRH/ECAM procedures or if aircraft weight exceeds the CONF&nbsp;3 go around limit (see QRH 2.25). Packs should
        be turned off to provide additional go around thrust. If planned landing configuration is less than FULL, use

        <para>The primary aim is to get the aircraft on the ground and evacuated ASAP.</para>

        <para>The secondary aim is to prevent detonation of the device. This is acheived by preventing further increases
        in cabin altitude through the use of manual pressure control and by avoiding sharp maneuvres and
        turbulence.</para>

        <para>The tertiary aim is to minimise the effect of any explosion. This is acheived by reducing the diff to 1
        psi. The method is to set cabin vertical speed to zero using manual pressurisation control, then descend to an
        altitude 2500ft above cabin altitude. As further descent is required, cabin vertical speed should be adjusted to
        maintain the 1 psi diff for as long as possible. Automatic pressure control is then reinstated on approach. Low
        speeds reduce the damage from an explosion but increase the risk of a timed explosion occuring whilst airborne;
        a compromise needs to be found. The aircraft should be configured for landing as early as possible to avoid an
        explosion damaging landing systems.</para>

        <title>Stall recovery <emphasis>(memory item)</emphasis></title>

        <para>Airbus have determined that there may be insufficient longitudinal control authority
        to recover from a stall if TOGA is selected. The generic stall recovery is therefore simply
        to pitch the nose down to break the stall and level the wings. Once there are no longer any
        indications of the stall, smoothly apply thrust, check speedbrakes retracted and if
        appropriate (clean and below 20,000ft) deploy the slats by selecting flaps 1.</para>

        <para>If a stall warner sounds on takeoff it is likely to be spurious since you are almost
        certainly in normal law. The procedure in this case is essentially to initially assume
        unreliable airspeed and fly TOGA, 15°, wings level until it can be confirmed that the
        warning is spurious.</para>

        <para>A stall warning may occur at high altitude to indicate that the aircraft is reaching
        &alpha;<subscript>buffet</subscript>. In this case simply reduce the back pressure on the

        <title>Computer reset</title>
        <para>Abnormal computer behaviour can often be stopped by interupting the power supply of the affected

        interupt the power supply, wait 3 seconds (5 seconds if a C/B was used), restore the power, then wait another
        three seconds for the reset to complete. Specific procedures are detailed in the computer reset tables on page
        2.36 of the QRH.</para>

        <para>On the ground, almost all computers can be reset. The exceptions are the ECU and EIU while the associated

        <para>There is no ECAM in the case of total loss of pressure control leading to an overpressure, so apply the

        and the remaining pack is turned off if it exceeds 9 psi. 10 minutes before landing, both packs are turned off
        and remain off, and the avionics ventilation is returned to its normal configuration.</para>

	<para>Airbus have identified a failure scenario that leads to high pressure hydraulic fluid reaching the extend

	account for the failure and should be disregarded. Green dot speed will minimize this increased fuel burn, but

      <sect1 id="flight-controls.slats-flaps-fault">
        <title>Flaps and/or slats fault/locked</title>

        <para>The most pressing concern following a flap or slat problem is to establish a max operating speed that will
        avoid overspeeding the device in its locked position. A table is provided on page 2.05 of the QRH for this
        purpose, but a quick estimation can be made by establishing what flap lever position would be required to get
        the device into its current position and using V<subscript>FE</subscript> for the configuration associated with
        that flap lever position as V<subscript>MO</subscript>. In doing this, it must be remembered that slat
        deployment in CONF 2 and CONF 3 is the same (tip: think of available slat positions as being 0, 1, Intermediate
        or Full). This also affects use of the QRH table; the second dot on the slat indicator on the E/WD should be
        considered slat 3 for the purpose of this table, not slat 2 as might be expected. The barber's pole displayed
        for V<subscript>FE</subscript> on the PFD is a function of the flap lever position, so it may be worth initially
        selecting the flap lever to the matching CONF to have this reference available. For minimum speeds, the
        V<subscript>LS</subscript> displayed on the PFD is calculated from actual flap and slat position and can be
        trusted.</para>

        <para>Unless there is an obvious reason not to (e.g. wing tip brake on, alignment fault or fault due to dual
        hydraulic failure), the flap lever can be recycled.</para>

        <para>If normal operation cannot be restored, there are two major issues that must be quickly
        addressed. Firstly, fuel burn will be dramatically higher when flying with a locked device. With slats extended,
        fuel burn will increase by 60%. With flaps extended it will increase by 80%. With slats and flaps extended, fuel
        burn will double. The paragraph at the bottom of page 2.05 of the QRH provides these figures. The second issue
        is that landing distances are significantly increased, in the worst case by a factor of 2.2. Landing distance
        can be assessed using the tables on page 2.32 and 4.03 of the QRH. It may be that the combination of these
        factors requires a fairly prompt diversion decision.</para>

        <para>The flap and slat systems are largely independent, so the flap lever will continue to move the slats if
        the flaps are locked and vice versa. In general, flap 3 should be selected for landing. There are two
        exceptions. If flaps are locked at &gt;3, flap full should be used. If both slats and flaps are locked at 0,
        flap 1 should be used so that the AP/FD go-around is armed. Configurations and V<subscript>REF</subscript>
        increments are available on page 2.32 of the QRH. If a flapless and slatless landing is required, the threshold
        speed in may be below V<subscript>LS</subscript>. This is necessary as the landing speeds in this configuration
        are very close to tyre limit speeds.</para>

        <para>During configuration, V<subscript>LS</subscript> is computed from actual configuration
        and V<subscript>FE next</subscript> is computed from flap lever position. F and S speeds are
        essentially meaningless. The deployment method is to reduce speed to slightly (5kt) below
        the limiting speed for a configuration before selecting it. If
        V<subscript>LS</subscript>&gt;V<subscript>FE next</subscript>, prioritise
        V<subscript>LS</subscript>: fly V<subscript>LS</subscript>, select the next configuration,
        then track V<subscript>LS</subscript> as it reduces with the extension of the lift
        device. In most cases, overspeed warnings can be avoided.</para>

        <para>It is worth noting that failure of the slat channels of both SFCCs appears to result in the loss of
        characterisic speed display on both PFDs. This is not mentioned in the FCOM but occurs in the sim. The upshot of
        this is that neither V<subscript>LS</subscript> nor V<subscript>SW</subscript> are available at all, since they
        are not displayed and there is no way to calculate them. This is of particular concern when trying to configure
        to flaps 2 since the aircraft must be slowed to V<subscript>FE(conf 2)</subscript>-5 when still clean (remember
        conf 1 is slats only when configuring from conf 0). It is highly likely that the stall warner will activate
        during the transition, and if not anticipated, the subsequent recovery will overspeed the flaps. The solution is
        to brief that speed will be reduced very slowly and if the stall warning occurs the speed will be maintained
        whilst allowing the deployment of the flaps to recover the stall margin.</para>

        <para>The autopilot may be used down to 500ft AAL, but since it is not tuned for the abnormal configuration it
        must be closely monitored.</para>

        <para>For the go-around, initially maintain flap/ slat configuration. A speed 10kt lower than max operating
        speed should be flown. If it is the slats that are jammed or if the flaps are jammed at 0, clean configuration
        can be used to transit to a diversion airfield.</para>

        <para>Other issues include the possible loss of the automatic operation of the centre tank pumps (which
        is sequenced to the slats) and possible reversion to Alternate Law.</para>

        spoiler position to the FACs. If speedbrakes are deployed with SEC 1 u/s and SEC 3 operative, spoiler 2 will
        deploy without a corresponding increase in V<subscript>LS</subscript>. Therefore, do not use speedbrake if SEC 1

        <title>Smoke and fumes</title>

        <para>The QRH procedure should be applied when smoke is detected and the crew suspect the avionics, air
        conditioning or cabin equipment as the source. The paper procedure includes all the steps of the avionics smoke
        ECAM procedure, so if this caution is triggered, the paper procedure should be applied after completing the
        immediate actions of the ECAM procedure.</para>

        <para>In the case of other smoke related ECAMs, the relevant ECAM procedure should be applied first and then the
        use of the paper checklist considered.</para>

        <para>Rain repellent fluid leaks are not covered. Orange peel smells are toxic, pine needle smells
        non-toxic.</para>

        <para>The SMOKE/ FUMES/ AVNCS SMOKE checklist attempts to isolate the source of the smoke. It is possible that
        it may become impossible to carry out this checklist due to smoke density. In this case, interrupt the checklist
        and carry out the smoke removal drill (see <xref linkend="smoke-fumes-removal"/>). It is also possible that the
        situation may deteriorate to a level that an immediate forced landing becomes the preferable option. In general,
        unless the source of the smoke is obvious and extinguishable, a diversion should be initiated immediately. The
        smoke removal drill is most effective and adaptable at lower levels, so a descent to 10,000ft or MSA is also a
        priority.</para>

        <para>The first priority is to protect yourself, so get an oxygen mask on. The mask must be
	set to 100% oxygen to exclude fumes; at minimum dispatch oxygen levels this will provide as
	little as 15 minutes of protection. Pushing the "Emergency pressure selector" knob will
	provide a few seconds of overpressure, which can be used to clear any smoke trapped in the
	mask as it was donned.</para>

        <para>The most likely sources are the avionics, the cabin fans and the galleys. Therefore immediate initial
        actions are to turn off the cabin fans and galleys and put the avionics ventilation in smoke removal mode by
        selecting both fans to OVRD.</para>

        <para>Where the smoke source is not immediately obvious and the initial actions have not caused it to cease, the
        QRH provides drills for suspected air conditioning smoke, suspected cabin equipment smoke or suspected
        avionics/ electrical smoke. In addition the avionics/ electrical smoke drill includes undetermined and
        continuing smoke sources.</para>

        <para>Suspect air conditioning smoke if it initially comes out of the ventilation outlets. Several ECAM warnings
        are also likely to occur as sensors detect the smoke in other areas. The displayed ECAM procedures must be
        applied. Following an engine or APU failure, smoke may initially enter the air conditioning system but should
        dissipate quickly once the failure is contained. The air conditioning drill starts by turning the APU bleed off
        in case this is the source. The packs are then turned off one at a time to determine if the source of the smoke
        is a pack.</para>

        <para>The cabin equipment smoke drill involves selecting the commercial button off and searching for faulty
        cabin equipment.</para>

        <para>Suspect avionics smoke if the only triggered ECAM is AVIONICS SMOKE. If an item of electrical equipment
        fails immediately prior to the appearance of the smoke, that equipment should be suspected as the source. The
        avionics/ electrical drill (which includes the undetermined source drill) no longer involves systematic shedding
        of the AC busses due to the negative interaction that this procedure had with the battery chargers. Instead,
        emergency electrical configuration (see <xref linkend="emerg-elec-config"/>) is adopted immediately. The
        electrical system should be restored just before deploying the gear. Note that since you will not be able to
        restore the two IRs that were depowered, the landing will be in Direct Law and hence CONF 3. Refer to QRH 2.32
        for V<subscript>App</subscript> and LDR factor. This is not mentioned in QRH 1.06, and is only mentioned on the

        <title>Fuel leak</title>

        <para>Whenever a non-normal fuel event occurs, the possibility that the underlying cause of the event is a fuel
        leak should be considered. Only when a fuel leak has been categorically ruled out should the cross-feed valve be
        opened.[FCTM 3.28]</para>

        <para>The primary method used to detect fuel leaks is a regular check that actual fuel remaining corresponds to
        expected fuel remaining and that fuel used plus fuel remaining corresponds to fuel at engine start. The latter
        parameter is monitored on some aircraft and may trigger an ECAM warning. Other indications of a leak include
        fuel imbalance or excessive fuel flow from an engine. It also possible that a fuel leak may be detected visually
        or by a smell of fuel in the cabin.</para>

        <para>If a leak can be confirmed to be coming from an engine or pylon, the affected engine must be shut down. In
        this case, cross-feeding is allowable. Otherwise, the cross-feed must be kept closed.</para>

        <para>If the leak cannot be confirmed to be originating from an engine or pylon, an attempt should be made to
        identify the source of the leak by monitoring the inner tank depletion rates with the crossfeed valve closed and
        the center tank pumps off.</para>

        <para>If depletion rates are similar, a leak from the center tank or from the APU feeding line should be
        suspected. If there is a smell of fuel in the cabin, it is likely that the APU feeding line is at fault and the
        APU should be turned off. Fuel from the center tank should be used once one of the inner tanks has
        &lt;3000kg. {TODO: I don't understand the logic here - surely an APU feeding line leak would cause the left tank
        to decrease faster than the right, and why not put the center tank pumps in AUTO and use the fuel as soon as
        possible if you suspect a leak from the center tank?}</para>

        <para>If, after 30 minutes, one tank has been depleted by 300kg more than the other, the location of leak is
        narrowed down to the engine or the wing on the more depleted side. To confirm which it is, shut down the engine.
        If the leak then stops, an engine leak is confirmed and the cross feed can be used. If not, a leak from the wing
        is most likely. In this case, an engine restart should be considered.</para>

        occurs when one inner tank holds &gt;1500kg more than the other. The limitations for fuel imbalance in

	<para>Defined as a rapid decrease in EGT, N2 and FF, followed by a decrease in N1. The crew

	moves the lever after confirmation from PNF). If the FADEC hasn't relit the failed engine
	within 30 seconds of the failure, it is shut down with the master switch. If damage is
	believed to have occured, the associated fire button is pushed and, after 10 seconds, agent
	1 discharged.</para>

	<para>If it is believed that the engine is undamaged, a relight can be considered. The

        <para>The most pressing issue is that a single engine cannot support wing anti-ice and two packs, so if wing
        anti-ice is in use, one of the packs must be turned off. This will generally be the pack on the affected side,
        but will need to be pack 1 in electrical emergency configuration. The cross bleed must be opened for symmetrical
        wing anti-icing. If a fire button has been pushed, the cross bleed cannot be opened, and wing anti-ice is

        <para>The remaining engine must be safeguarded. To this end, continuous ignition should be selected.</para>

        <para>A fuel imbalance may develop. Fuel imbalance limitations are detailed in FCOM 3.1.28.
        If the outer tanks are balanced, once the fuller inner tank contains less than 2250kg, fuel
        balance will never be limiting. Since this first occurs with approximately 5900kg of fuel
        remaining, fuel balancing due to balance limitations will generally not be required. Fuel
        may, however, still need to be crossfed to prevent fuel starvation of the remaining
        engine. Balance this concern against feeding your live engine the same fuel that was feeding

        <para>The concept is to blow the fire out by dry cranking the engine. It is therefore essential that the fire
        button is <emphasis>not</emphasis> pressed, as this will remove external power from the FADEC and prevent dry
        cranking. Firstly, a source of bleed air must be available to power the starter. Possibilities, in order of
        preference, are the APU, the opposite engine or a ground air cart. If using the opposite engine, the source
        engine bleed must be on, the target engine bleed should be off, the cross bleed should be opened and thrust
        increased to provide 30 psi of pressure. {TODO: This is just the crossbleed start procedure from 3.4.70.4000 -
        check that there are no differences}. If using ground air, both engine bleeds should be off and the cross bleed

        <title>EGPWS alerts <emphasis>(memory item)</emphasis></title>

        <para>EPGWS alerts can be categorised into warnings and cautions. A warning is any alert with the instruction
        "Pull up" attached. All other alerts are cautions. A warning may be downgraded to a caution if flying in
        daylight VMC and positive visual verification is made that no hazard exists [EOM-A 8.3.5].</para>

        <para>The response to a warning is to call "Pull up, TOGA", disconnect the autopilot and simultaneously roll the
        wings level, apply full backstick and set TOGA power. The speedbrake should then be checked retracted. Once the
        flight path is safe and the warning stops, accelerate and clean up as required.</para>

        <para>The response to a caution is to correct the flight path or aircraft configuration as necessary. A
        configuration warning will almost always require a go around.</para>

        <para>TCAS warnings may be either traffic advisories ("Traffic, Traffic") or resolution advisories (anything
        else). The first response to either advisory is to call "TCAS, I have control" to unequivocally establish who
        will be carrying out any maneuvers. If it is a resolution advisory, the autopilot should be disconnected and the
        flight directors turned off. The autothrottle remains engaged and reverts to speed mode. A vertical maneuver
        should then be flown to keep the V/S needle out of the red areas shown on the V/S scale. ATC should then be
        notified (e.g "Radar, Easy 123 - TCAS RA"). When clear of conflict, return to assigned level and re-engage the
        automatics (ATC phraseology: "Radar, Easy 123 - clear of conflict, returning to FL XXX").</para>

        <title>RNAV downgrades</title>

        <para>If an ECAM or MCDU message indicates navigation accuracy is compromised whilst flying in RNP-5 (BRNAV)
        airspace, a navigation check should be made using the GPS MONITOR page or raw radio aid data. If a single FMGC
        is at fault, navigation can be continued using the other FMGC. If RNP-5 ability has been lost, inform ATC and
        continue with conventional navigation. The IRS provides RNP-5 required accuracy for two hours from last
        alignment regardless of MCDU ENP.</para>

        <para>In an RNP-1 (PRNAV) environment, loss of navigation accuracy may be more serious as the aircraft may be
        below MSA when it occurs. The initial response is to notify ATC with the phrase "Unable RNAV due equipment" and
        request reclearance. It is important to be aware that terrain clearance may be compromised, so an immediate
        climb above MSA should be considered if a suitable alternative navigation method (e.g. radar vectors) is not
        available.</para>

        <para>In general, an RNP-1 approach only requires the availability of a single RNAV system consisting of one
        FMGC, one MCDU, one sensor (GPS, VOR or DME), one IRS and one FD in NAV mode. GPS PRIMARY is not normally a
        requirement, but if it is not available ensure that RNP is set to 1, NAV ACCURACY is high and a raw data check
        is carried out prior to commencement of the procedure.</para>

        <para>Some RNP-1 procedures include extra restrictions such as the mandatory use of GPS or the availability of
        two RNAV systems. If a failure occurs that breaches one of these restrictions, procede as for a loss of
        navigation accuracy.</para>

        <title>ADR faults</title>

        <para>A single ADR fault simply requires switching to the hot spare and turning the affected unit off. Loss of
        ADR1 will lead to the loss of the extended functions of the EGPWS. Loss of ADR2 will lead to both baro reference
        channels being driven by the same FCU channel {TODO: Find out details of this}, so the baro refs should be
        checked.</para>

        <para>Loss of two ADRs will lead to Alternate Law with associated speed restrictions and landing configuration
        considerations. Air data switching is used as necessary, and the affected ADRs are turned off. ATC switching may
        be required to restore transponder. If ADR 1 and 3 are lost, the landing gear safety valve is controlled closed,
        so the gear must be gravity extended and cannot subsequently be retracted. This is not mentioned by the ECAM -
        the gear will simply fail to extend normally.</para>

        <para>Loss of all ADRs requires reversion to standby instruments. Disregard ECAM actions as the ECAM procedures
        shown will be for single ADR operation and will direct you towards meaningless air data and ATC switching. Refer
        instead to page 2.20 of the QRH. In addition to the failures associated with dual loss, the stall warning is
        lost, the rudder travel limiter is frozen (full rudder travel will be recovered at slat extension) and automatic
        cabin pressure control is lost. In case of go-around, auto flap retraction is not available.</para>

        with altitude, so it may be possible to reinstate the system during the descent.</para>

        <title>Multiple pitot heat failures</title>

        <para>The issue with loss of anti-ice on more than one pitot probe is that it is possible that the two
        unprotected pitot probes will ice up at the same time and provide erroneous but coherent data. This leads to a
        situation where the ADR associated with the remaining protected probe is locked out despite being the single
        correct source.</para>

        <para>Obviously, the first thing to do is to avoid icing conditions. If there is a working ADR connected to a
        protected probe, turn one of the ADRs associated with an unprotected probe off. This ensures that an "ADR
        DISAGREE" ECAM caution is triggered by significant speed discrepancies and ensures that the protected ADR will
        not be automatically deselected.</para>

        <para>If pitot heat is lost on all probes, one of the ADRs should, again, be turned off to ensure the "ADR
        DISAGREE" ECAM caution is provided. If icing is expected, turn off a second ADR and be ready to apply unreliable
        airspeed procedures (see <xref linkend="unreliable-airspeed"/>).</para>

        <title>Dual bleed failure</title>

        <para>A known problem with the A319 is that the load on a single bleed supplying two packs at high altitude may
        be sufficient to cause it to trip off. In this case, turning off one pack may allow a bleed reset.</para>

        <para>There is no ECAM associated with a dual bleed failure. The QRH 2.02 procedure applies both to the case
        where the aircraft has dispatched with an inoperative bleed IAW MEL, and in the case where an in-flight failure
        has left a single bleed remaining.</para>

        <para>In the case of an isolated bleed duct (due bleed air leak, engine fire or failed open start valve), the
        bleed associated with the duct is clearly unrecoverable. Since the remaining bleed would only have been
        supplying a single pack, the overload case does not apply. Hence, this bleed is also considered unrecoverable,
        and a bleed reset should not be attempted. If, on the other hand, both ducts are available and a single bleed
        has been supplying two packs, an overload may be suspected and an attempt can be made to reset the overloaded
        bleed once one of the packs is turned off.</para>

        <para>If an engine bleed cannot be recovered, providing #1 bleed duct is available, the APU bleed may be used to
        supply a single pack when below FL225. If the #2 bleed duct is isolated, only pack 1 can be used since the cross
        bleed will be closed. Otherwise, either pack may be used. Note that the APU bleed is not capable of supplying
        bleed air for wing anti-ice.</para>
